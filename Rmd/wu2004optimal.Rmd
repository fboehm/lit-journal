## Model 

$$y = X\beta + \sum_{j = 1}^{n_{qtl}}Q_jC_ja_j + \epsilon$$



## Sketch of MCMC sampling

- scalar MH procedure

1. update the number of alleles at each QTL
1. Update the allelic configuration $C_j$ at each QTL conditional on its number of alleles $l$
1. Update QTL allele effects variance for each QTL
1. Update allele effects $a_j$ at each QTL
1. Update QTL position $\lambda_j$ and QTL genotypes $Q_j$ for each QTL
1. Update family means $\beta_j$
1. Update residual variance $\sigma^2_e$

*Note that the number of QTL is fixed*. @sillanpaa1998bayesian is one 
work that esimates the number of QTL, too.

## Questions

Can their use of multiple families somehow be translated into using DO and CC?? 

How can we adapt this procedure to include estimation of the number of QTL?

What are alternatives to MCMC sampling?
